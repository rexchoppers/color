# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github][link-github].


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard][link-psr2]** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer][link-code-sniffer].

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0][link-semver]. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them][link-squashing] before submitting.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```


**Happy coding**!
